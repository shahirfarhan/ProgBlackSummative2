Entry 1:
Started to learn on how to use Unity and how to write in C#. I've learned on how to navigate through Unity and how to use all the basic features.
Also brainstorming the concepts of the game and how i want it to look like. Main idea for now is to make a game setting in space, where a spaceship is being
chased by an enemy and it has to collect fuels in order to keep flying and need to avoid asteroids as well. Probably make some story about it. What i need to
do next is to collaborate with another contributor to make some sprites and start coding for the game.

Entry 2:
Started the game by making the background moves and added the spaceship sprite, which can move left and right when left or right keys are pressed. Learned how to use Input.GetAxisRaw in Unity. Next step is to ensure that the spaceship sprite stays in the frame of the game and to also generate asteroid (obstacle) and fuel at random location.
