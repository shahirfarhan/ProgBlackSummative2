Having no experience in game development as well as C# and Unity are the main reason why I decided to pick up these skills. It allows me to challenge myself to start a project from scratch as well as enhancing my ability in self-learning. From my personal experience, prior knowledge/experience are not necessary as you can always learn by many different resources on the internet. Furthermore, game development allows me to explore my creative side as well as fulfilling my curiosity of how a game is made.

As mentioned, I started the project with zero knowledge in game development. What I personally find useful to start is to familiarize yourself with the Unity interface, as it is where you will mostly get your work done. When I started the project, this one specific resource has helped me to understand the UI better (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM). And of course, you need to brainstorm ideas for your game. This is where things get interesting as you can get as creative as you want! Don’t worry about how to implement your ideas into codes as there are a lot of resources available for you to learn from. Moreover, my learning log is mainly for people who are interested in exploring game development for the first time. So, it’s going to be explained is a very simple way.

For my specific project, I found a few knowledge to be completely useful. Firstly, there is a feature called prefabs in Unity, where it allows you to store a reusable game object that can be used multiple times. It basically acts like a template where you can keep on using the same game object for multiple scenes. Here are two links that helped me to understand it better, https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyhRXMkW1ns. Secondly, there is coroutine and instantiate, which I used to generate a multiple copy of a game object (in this case the asteroid and the fuel). Coroutine allows you to make a pause in your codes where instantiate let you to make a clone of an existing game object. Here are some links, https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html and https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html. 

Other than that, there were times when you need to access other C# script from another script, this is necessary as sometimes you might need to access the variable or functions from another script. I was initially struggling until I found a resource that has helped me, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llcE7gzhoiU. Furthermore, another knowledge that I found very useful is to understand how collisions and trigger works in unity, this is necessary as in my case, I need to do something when the spaceship collided with the asteroid or the fuel. There are multiple different ways you can do this, here are links for some resources, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc9lmHjqLZc and https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerEnter.html. Personally, I don’t think C# is a hard language to learn in general, at least in case for Unity. So, don’t worry too much if you have no experience with C# as you will get the hang of it through the process of working on your project. 

Another fascinating thing that I have learned in Unity is how to manage your scenes. In my case, this is useful when you are making the main menu page, where the start button allows the player to start the game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuAwAYDaV5U). 

Generally speaking, I think everyone should give game development a one fair tries to see how much you enjoy it, as well as to gain more experience in the programming industry. By learning game development, it has helped me to improve my problem-solving skills, as well as gaining knowledge in general. I would say that it is worth it to put an amount of effort to learn game development. If you are trying to find other alternatives instead of Unity, I have heard a few good things from a friend about another engine called Godot, which you can give a try if you are interested.
