Entry 1:
Started to learn on how to use Unity and how to write in C#. I've learned on how to navigate through Unity and how to use all the basic features.
Also brainstorming the concepts of the game and how i want it to look like. Main idea for now is to make a game setting in space, where a spaceship is being
chased by an enemy and it has to collect fuels in order to keep flying and need to avoid asteroids as well. Probably make some story about it. What i need to
do next is to collaborate with another contributor to make some sprites and start coding for the game.

Entry 2:
Started the game by making the background moves and added the spaceship sprite, which can move left and right when left or right keys are pressed. Learned how to use Input.GetAxisRaw in Unity. Next step is to ensure that the spaceship sprite stays in the frame of the game and to also generate asteroid (obstacle) and fuel at random location.

Entry 3:
Made some minor adjustment where instead of making the game vertically, changed it horizontally. Worked on making the spaceship stays within the screen boundary. Also worked on generating asteroids at random position. I have learned on how to work on the boundary of the main camera. Next, need to generate fuel sprite (just exactly same as asteroids) and what happened when the spaceship and asteroid collide with each other.

Entry 4:
Worked on generating fuel sprite at random location, added score on the upper left side of the game and worked on making the fuel sprite disappear on collision with the spaceship. Gained more understanding on how to work with collider. Next need to work on fuel bar (keep on decreasing and increase once the spaceship gain more fuel).

Entry 5:
Fixed some bug on the boundary of the spaceship (to keep it within the frame). Then added the alien sprite and make it follows the spaceship (as if it is chasing it). Changed to new sprite, where it is now an animation (which i got from a contributor) .Also worked on the fuel bar, where few features has been added e.g., it keeps on decreasing throughout the game and gained fuel when the spaceship collects the fuel. Next, need to work on how the game ends (the game over).

Entry 6:
Worked on the game over screen (when the spaceship hits the asteroid or when run out of fuel). Also worked on the logic e.g., the score, the fuel and the spaceship should froze when the game is over. Also added a main menu page. Learned about creating different scenes in Unity and also how TMP button is different from normal button. Pretty much how i want the game to be now.
